# JVGraph

JVGraph is a graph library which can build directed or undirected graph. Also, it gives the option to have Weighted or Unweighted graph. 
JVGraph implements some of the well-known graph algorithms such as: Dijekstra Algorithm and Prim Spanning Tree.


## Getting Started

This project is a free Java graph library that provides graph objects and algorithms. 
This library supports different graph algorithms and structure, such as:

* Directed and undirected graphs.
* Graphs with weighted / unweighted edges.
* Dijekstra Algorithm.
* Prim Spanning Tree.

It also includes some iterators for the graph like:
* Breadth First Iterator
* Depth First Iterator
* Topological Order Iterator


## Running the tests

Test Package includes multiple java files that test the functionality of different algorithms with different structure of graphs.

## Versioning

Version 1.0
